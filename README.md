## Suggested Strategy
1. Attend the data prep session for data munging tips. Allocate an hour to get familiar with the data sources, explore the data, decide on
specific aspects you’d like to focus on. Agree with the group on a specific set of questions/hypotheses you’d like to study. Form your problem statement to frame your analysis.

2. Pull together the specific data you need for your analysis.
3. Join various data sources if needed, create new features if needed to support your analysis.

## The first mentoring session
- great opportunity to bring up any questions or challenges you face through the data munging process
- ask for feedback on your approach and assumptions.

4. Explore the data set you put together and apply modeling as needed to carry out your analysis and test your hypotheses.
5. Put together visualisations that demonstrate your findings.

## The second mentoring session
- provides a chance to consult on modeling and visualisation approaches
- Throughout the analysis you may find that new hypotheses emerge
- On the second day, focus on consolidating your findings
